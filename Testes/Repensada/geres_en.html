    <title>Peneda-Gerês Natural Park</title>

<body>
    <h1>Gerês without a car</h1>
    <p>
        Yes, it is possible to visit the Natural Park of Peneda-Gerês without a car. Of course, you will need some
        adaptation, you need to like walking and you might not visit all of the "must go" spots from the major blogs
        lists.
        If your intention is to spend some quiet days in the middle of nature, I guarantee this place is worth it!
    </p>
    <p>
        Gerês is a democratic place in my opinion. The main touristic attractions are well structured. For example, the
        Pedra Bela, Boneca, Fraga Negra, and Jucenda have fences, stairs, and parking lots nearby; the Arado, the
        Varzeas
        (Fecha de Barjas), and the Homen waterfalls are just a few steps away from the main road. But it's also possible
        to
        make some amazing trails in the middle of nature listen to the sound of birds, the water flowing everywhere, and
        be
        completely alone for long hours! I believe Gerês has space for both kinds of tourists: the more adventurous ones
        and
        the ones that like seeing nature but don't want to (or can't) walk.
    </p>
    <p>

        For me, the most beautiful landscapes were in the middle of the way. The official viewpoints are toward the city
        and
        I prefer a more natural view with less human intervention as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The weather in Gerês can be a little bit unstable. I was there during March; I went out in the morning with a
        blue
        sky and came back in the middle of the afternoon with rain, and the other way around also happened often. For
        this
        reason, it's good to have at least an impermeable jacket and a good pair of walking shoes. Some of the trails
        have
        slippery sandy parts or are made through rocks, so it's important to wear proper shoes and pay attention to your
        way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gerês is a small village, the market is ok for basic things like rice, pasta, and frozen things, but vegetable
        options are limited. The products are not overpriced though. The accommodations might be simple, don't expect
        luxury, the main goal here is to enjoy nature. The village has no hostel option but there are some simple and
        not
        that expensive hotel options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The village has only one main street, if you go there you will find the pharmacy, ATM, handcraft stores, and
        restaurants. During low season there was only one restaurant open, the Lurdes Capela, so it's better to try to
        contact the place before going. If you want to save money on cooking by yourself or have any diet restrictions
        is
        better to buy things before going to Gerês.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important thing is that during the low season, there was no Uber available, only the city's cab company.
        I'm
        not sure if it changes in high season, but I would not count on that.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all that said, let's move to some practical things:
    </p>
    <h2>
        Arriving in Gerês</h2>
    <p>
        I took a bus at Braga's main bus station to Gerês, with the bus company "Empresa Hoteleira do Gerês" - a blue
        bus
        that usually stops at spot number 18 (you can check this information on the screens at the bus station). The
        ticket
        cost €4,50 in 2022 and you can buy it directly with the bus driver. You can check the timetable in advance on
        the
        website, a very simple page with just the timetable, no additional information. Be aware if you are going on
        holiday
        or during the weekend because the time options reduce drastically and there is no information service at the bus
        station during this period. The bus will leave you on the village's main street, right in front of the Hotel
        Universal.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the trails, I used an app called Komoot. It does the planning of the route when online and it also works as
        an
        offline map. If your cellphone has a good reliable GPS, it's the perfect tool! I was able to find the most
        untrackable ways by following the GPS position on the app (the trails are shown as dark solid lines).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to make some trails without a car, starting from the village center. You might just need a little
        bit
        more physical disposition. Here are the trails I did.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trails that you can do without a car from Gerês Village (You have the Komoot link on each title)
        Fraga Negra Viewpoint (575 m de alt.)
        Half an hour walking from the village center, always going uphill. The way is well marked and most of it is made
        by
        the road.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Boneca's Viewpoint (750 m de alt.)
    </h3>
    Forty minutes walking uphill from the Fraga Negra's viewpoint. This was one of the spots in Gerês where I enjoyed
    the climb more than the viewpoint itself.

    Junceda's Viewpoint (915 m de alt.)
    I followed the clockwise way of the Komoot circuit. It took two hours to get to the viewpoint and I could not make
    the end of the path because of the thicket on the way so I had to go back from where I started.

    Pedra Bela's Viewpoint (829 m de alt.)
    A one-hour steep and a little bit slippery trail, always going uphill (believe me, it's easier to do the way up than
    the down one). You can also go easily by car if you have one (it was not my case).

    Arado Waterfall (750 m de alt.)
    You can go there from the Pedra Bela's viewpoint by the road or following the Komoot shortcut. It's also possible to
    get there by car.

    Poço Azul (Blue Lake)
    With a total distance of 20 km from the village center, the path itself is not difficult, but it is long. You will
    pass by the Boneca's viewpoint and by the Arado waterfall. I followed the Komoot route by some thicket path using
    the cellphone's GPS. In case you have a car (or a ride), you can begin the trail at the Arado waterfall. From this
    point, it's an easy flat path of about 1:30h till the astonishing blue lake.

    Vale do Teixeira
    One of my favorite trails in Gerês. It starts at the village and passes through some breathtaking landscapes. The
    Komoot loop also passes by the Arado waterfall and the Pedra Bela Viewpoint. It's around 15 km with 2 hours of
    walking uphill and sometimes the path is not very clear so you need to follow the GPS. It's hard but definitely
    worth it if you like hiking and being in nature.

    Sete Lagoas (Seven Lakes)
    This is another one of my favorite trails in Gerês but unfortunately, it needs a car to be done. I had a ride from
    the hotel owner. So if you have the chance to do this (taking a cab, a tour, or a ride) I highly recommend it! The
    beginning of the trail is 27 km away from the village, about 1-hour driving. The reference for the beginning point
    is Google's location of "Bar Sete Lagoas", in Xertelo.

    From this point, it's only 5 km distance each way, mostly flat. It's not a difficult trail, I just don't recommend
    it for people who have fear of height as it's made by the edge of the cliff.

    The mountain view is incredible, we pass by some waterfalls and big rocks on the way. By the end of the trail, you
    have that amazing blue watercolor lagoons! If the weather is good you can swim in them.
